## 0.1.0 - 2020-01-14

-   Add Service caching.
   -   To cache the result of a Service call, be sure the Service implements the CachedService interface and implement the interface methods:
      -   ```CachedService::cacheIdentifier()``` should return a unique string to be used as the cache key.
      -   ```CachedService::cacheTime()``` should return a ```DateTimeInterface```, ```DateInterval```, an integer (seconds), or null.
   -   To clear the cache, you may either use the key and clear the cache via the different ways that Laravel provides, or use the
       ```PerfectOblivion\ActionServiceProvider\Services\CacheHandler::forget($service)``` method. You may pass the name of the Service to the
       ```forget()``` method. If you have an instance of the Service, you may pass it instead of the Service name.
